<h1>Post-Contest Information</h1>


<div style="margin : 12px ; text-align : justify ; background : #345678 ; border : 1px dashed #89ABCD ; padding : 6px">
  The contest has ended, but many people have found the task to be
  interesting and fun to complete even when not competing for a
  prize. The publications mentioned in the <a href="task.shtml">task
  description</a> cannot be validated online or counted on the
  scoreboard. However, it is possible to validate publications and
  tally your score offline, using a program that can be discovered
  somewhere within the codex.  </div>

<h1>Rules</h1>

<p>What follows are the official rules for the contest.</p>

<h2>Dates and Times</h2><a name="dates"></a>

<p>The contest will run from July&nbsp;21 to July&nbsp;24, 2006. The contest
task was announced at 12:00 (noon) EDT on Friday, and we will
accept entries until 12:00 (noon) EDT on Monday. 

<h2>Teams</h2><a name="teams"></a>

<p>This is an open contest. There is no entry fee or need to
pre-register and everyone (with the exception of faculty, students,
and staff of Carnegie Mellon University) is eligible. Teams may work
from any location.</p>

<p>A team consists of every person who contributes ideas or code
towards a submission. Individuals may only be members of a single team
and teams may not divide or collaborate with each other once the
contest has begun.</p>

<p>For this contest there will be two divisions: One for <b>small
teams</b> and one for <b>large teams</b>. A small team consists of
0&ndash;4 persons. A large team may have any number of members. Teams
may switch from the small team division to the large team division at
any time (even once the contest has begun) if they wish to take on new
members. Large teams are not eligible for the first place prize, but
otherwise the two divisions are identical.

<h2>Language and tools</h2>

<p>Teams may work in any programming language(s) that they wish. They may
employ any computational resources at their disposal.</p>

<h2>Prizes</h2>

<p>There will be four prizes: First, second, and third place, as well
as a discretionary judges' prize. Prize money totaling $1750 US will
be awarded to help defray the costs of travel to the contest for the
winners and for small cash prizes. In addition, the organizers will
declare during the conference that 

<ul>
 <li>The first place team's language is <i>the programming language of choice for discriminating hackers</i>,</li>
 <li>the second place team's language is <i>a fine tool for many applications</i>,
 <li>the third place team's language is <i>not too shabby</i>,
 <li>and the team winning the judge's prize is <i>an extremely cool bunch of hackers</i>.
</ul>

<h1>Contest-Specific Rules</h1>

<ul>

<li>Instructions:
<ul>
<!-- <li><a href="/register.shtml">Register</a> to receive a decryption key.</li> -->
 <li>Register to receive a decryption key.</li>
 <li>Download the codex and the UM specification.</li>
 <li>Implement the UM and run the codex.</li>
 <li>Supply the decryption key you received from us.</li>
<!-- <li>Obtain publications and <a href="http://www.icfpcontest.org/submit.shtml">submit them</a>.</li> -->
 <li>Obtain publications and submit them.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>
  The team with most points after three days wins.  Earlier time of
  final publication will be used to break ties, where each team's
  final publication is the last submitted publication that increases
  their score.
</li>

<li>
  Retain your source code.  Top ranking teams will be required to
  submit their source code for peer review.  After the contest, teams
  that wish to be considered for the Judges' Prize will submit their
  source code and a brief commentary.
</li>

<li>
  Different solutions to a given task may yield different publications
  depending on the quality of the solution.  Better solutions will yield
  better scoring publications.  For any given task, your final score will
  reflect your best submitted publication.
</li>

<li>
  A given publication will always earn the same score, regardless of when
  it is submitted, and regardless of any submissions of other teams.
</li>

<li>
  All participants must adhere to the spirit of the contest. For
  example, teams that attempt to forge publications or manipulate the
  behavior of the codex will be disqualified.
</li>
</ul>



<h1>FAQ</h1>

<ol>

<!--
already answered above.
<li>
Do we have to use the same language for the entire contest?
<div class="answer">
No, you don't.
</div>
</li>
-->

<li>
If I use more than one language, and I win, what language will receive the declaration?
<div class="answer">
The winners may choose what language they wish to honor.
</div>
</li>

<li>
Can I submit more than one publication for a given task?  Will that affect my
score?
<div class="answer">
  Yes, you can.  Submitting a valid publication will never decrease
  your score.  For some tasks you can improve your score by submitting
  an improved publication.  Re-submitting an identical publication 
  will never change your score.
</div>
</li>

<li>
How long is the codex supposed to take to run?
<div class="answer">
  We have a variety of implementations of the Universal Machine. On a
  1 Ghz Pentium M laptop, it takes us approximately 1 minute and 40 seconds
  to decode the codex.
</div>
</li>

<!--
<li>
I accidentally registered my team twice, and got two
different emails with team information.  What should I do?
<div class="answer">
  Pick one of the emails and use it consistently.
</div>
</li>
-->

<li>
My UM implementation says "self-check succeeded" but fails to decrypt
the codex.  Is there something wrong with my decryption key?
<div class="answer">
  No, the decryption keys are correct; there is a bug in your UM
  implementation.  The codex self-check is not at all exhaustive.
</div>
</li>

<li>
What kind of reverse engineering am I allowed to do?
<div class="answer">
  If you're worried that something you plan to do might violate the
  spirit of the contest, please ask us first. We have discussed some
  specifics in a <a
  href="http://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/pipermail/icfpcontest-announce/Week-of-Mon-20060717/000004.html">message</a>
  to the announce list.
</div>
</li>

<li>
Does your web server really run UM code?
<div class="answer">Most certainly.</div>
</li>

</ol>

<h1>Known Transcription Errors</h1><a name="errata"></a>
<p>Volume 9 of the codex contains corrections to all known
transcription errors found in previous releases.  If you discover any
errors, please report them to the <a
href="contact.shtml">contest organizers</a>.
</p>

<!--
<p>Volume 8 of the codex contains a few known errors. 
If you discover any additional errors, please report them to
the <a href="contact.shtml">contest organizers</a>.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Two lines were inadvertently omitted from the circuits spec.  
In the definition of open characters, the paragraph which discusses
= and ! should begin:</p>

<p>The = character on the south face of a box is open to its south, and
the = character on the north face of a box is open to its north.
The ! character on the east side of a box is open to its east, and
the ! character on the west side of a box is open to its west.</p>

<p>This change explains why the parser rejects some programs involving
the + character which otherwise seem to be in accord with the spec.</p>
</li>


<li>
In the Balance language (user account 'yang'), a negative instruction
speed has a curious behavior.  At each step, the new instruction pointer
computed is 
<span class="balance">(((IS + IP) mod 2<sup>32</sup>) mod length(CODE))</span>,
not
<span class="balance">((IS + IP) mod length(CODE))</span>.  

A Balance Certified Professional Programmer should treat the behavior of
<span class="balance">step_balance</span> and <span
class="balance">certify</span> as definitive.  </li>

<li> In the Balance language (user account 'yang'), the spec for the
<span class="balance">fillmem</span> problem should give the following
initial memory: 

<pre class="twod" style="width : auto">
a i j 0 1 2 4 8 0 0 0 0 0 . . .
</pre>

A Balance Certified Professional Programmer should treat the initial
memory configuration of <span class="balance">certify</span> as authoritative. 
</li>
-->

<!--
<li>A syntax error in a 2D program can cause UMIX to crash
gracefully. This should not affect any valid solutions. An example
program that triggers this bug is:
<pre class="twod" style="width : auto">
,.....................................
:mult                                :
:                                    :
:                                    :
,....................................,
</pre>
The top-right character in this program should be a comma, not a period.
</li>
