<PRE>
The 9th Annual ICFP Programming Contest has come to an end!
Thank you all so much for participating.

We wish to recognize the remarkable amount of work that teams put into
participating in this contest. In all, 364 teams submitted at least
one publication, and at least 150 made substantial progress on one or
more puzzles. More than 60 brave teams registered in the last 24 hours
alone!

Updates to the global scoreboard were turned off at 4:00am EDT, so the
standings now shown on the scoreboard do not reflect the final scores.
We will announce the results of the contest at ICFP in September. At
that time we will also release details of how we created the contest.
We also plan to re-launch an updated Codex on a permanent site, so
that programmers can continue to test their skills and experiment with
it indefinitely.

Please remember to upload your code and set your team information for
the final standings. You can do this from your private team page any
time until noon EDT this Wednesday.

In the meantime, we can make available some of the fruits of our own
research into the Cult of the Bound Variable. For example, after
studying the Universal Machine intently over the course of the
weekend, we are pleased to announce our own reference implementation.
You may find it a convenient aid to your studies. It is found at the
bottom of this message in uuencode format, and is available from our
website:

   <A HREF="http://boundvariable.org/um.um">http://boundvariable.org/um.um</A>

This implementation supports all UM programs, including uncompressed
.um files and self-decompressing .umz files. To use this
implementation to run a UM binary called c.um, simply concatenate the
two files together:

cat um.um c.um &gt; cmu.um

The resulting binary can be run in any compliant universal machine
implementation, including itself.


Invariably yours,
The 2006 ICFP Contest Organizers
